# Horizontal and Vertical Analysis

## Triggers

Use for peer benchmarking, alternative comparison, historical evolution, or trend inflection analysis.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use when there is one local fact, no comparable baseline, or comparison would not affect the decision.

## Inputs

Entities, comparison dimensions, time window, normalized units, and decision criteria.

## Procedure

1. Normalize definitions and measurement dates.
2. Compare peers across the same dimensions.
3. Trace each relevant dimension over time.
4. Explain divergences and identify decision-changing variables.

## Observable output

A normalized comparison matrix, time-direction findings, and named divergence drivers.

## Composition

Combine with `steelman-comparison` or `fact-checking`; use no more than three reasoning skills total.

## Permissions

This skill grants no data, file, network, dependency, delivery, or destructive permission.
