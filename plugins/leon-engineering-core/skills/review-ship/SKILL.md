# Review Ship

Inventory the diff and group changes by behavior, contract, configuration, migration, dependency, documentation, and generated artifact. Map each group to the required test, review, and rollout evidence.

Review high-risk trust boundaries, authorization, input handling, secrets, remote effects, migrations, CI, and platform constraints. Run only applicable checks, report their exact results, and label every omitted or failed check.

Do not approve a handoff from intent alone. The final handoff lists changed files, verified commands, blockers, rollback considerations, and ownership of follow-up work.
